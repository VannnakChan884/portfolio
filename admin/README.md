## 4. Security Considerations

1. **Password Hashing**: Always use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
3. **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens to forms
4. **Session Security**: Use secure, HTTP-only cookies
5. **Access Control**: Restrict admin access to authorized users only

## 5. Features Included

- Secure login system
- Dashboard with statistics
- Project management (CRUD)
- Message viewing
- Responsive design
- Form validation
- Success/error messaging

To implement this:

1. Create the `admin` directory structure
2. Add the database tables
3. Create each PHP file with the provided code
4. Secure your admin directory with `.htaccess` if using Apache

Would you like me to add any specific features to this admin panel? Such as:
- User management for multiple admins
- Image upload functionality
- Portfolio content editing
- Backup/restore functionality
- Activity logging
